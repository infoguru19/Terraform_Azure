## Very common real-world Terraform problem 👍
### an environment isolation issue.

## Right now:
- Dev and Prod are managed together
- Same Terraform state
- Same configuration
- So changing VM size for Dev also affects Prod

### That’s dangerous in production 🚨

## 🎯 Goal

- Change VM size in Dev
- WITHOUT affecting Prod

✅ Recommended Solutions
✅✅ (BEST PRACTICE): Separate State for Dev and Prod

💡 Golden Rule:
`One environment = One Terraform state`
